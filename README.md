Project Overview:
This project centers around a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition within a company, utilizing a CSV-formatted HR data file as the primary data source. The objective, as requested by our client, is to provide an in-depth exploration and understanding of the factors influencing employee attrition.

Data Preparation:
The first step in this analysis involved the extraction and cleansing of the HR data using Power BI Power Query. This process ensured that the data was in a pristine and usable state for subsequent analysis.

Visualization:
A critical aspect of this analysis was the use of various data visualization techniques to present the insights gained from the HR data. These visualizations provided a clear and intuitive means of conveying complex information.

Key Findings and Insights:
Throughout the analysis, several noteworthy insights and patterns emerged. These findings were derived from the visualizations and supported by rigorous statistical analysis.

KPI Development:
To address the specific needs of our client, we leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries within Power BI to create new calculated columns. These columns were instrumental in calculating and presenting key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to employee attrition.

Conclusions:
In summary, this data analysis project represents a thorough examination of employee attrition within the company, leveraging Power BI's capabilities for data preparation, visualization, and KPI generation. The insights gained serve as a valuable resource for strategic decision-making and addressing attrition-related challenges.
